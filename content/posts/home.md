## Who are we?
Eiram's Virtue Cantina is located on Eirie in the Eiram system in the Outer Rim of the Galaxy. Since the fall of the Empire, it has been a moderately successful hub of Force relic trade. However it is best known as a waystation for those traveling between the Outer Rim and Mid Rim.

### Pazaak
Bring your side deck, or rent one from the cantina.  Side decks can contain only 10 cards.

### Sabacc
The Empire did many terrible things, but bringing Coruscant Shift to the galaxy at wide was not one of them. 
Other variants played include Corellian Spike and Kessel.
