      <description>Who are we? Eiram&amp;rsquo;s Virtue Cantina is located on Eirie in the Eiram system in the Outer Rim of the Galaxy. Since the fall of the Empire, it has been a moderately successful hub of Force relic trade. However it is best known as a waystation for those traveling between the Outer Rim and Mid Rim.
Pazaak Bring your side deck, or rent one from the cantina. Side decks can contain only 10 cards.</description>
